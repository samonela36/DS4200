                    Chester Square Neighbors seeked to better understand public transportation habits
                    near their neighborhood. By combining several datasets provided by the MBTA, our group
                    was able to create a visualization that offers insights into how often people use 
                    the relevant public transportation stations, and when during the day they use them.
                    <br><br>
                    We discovered that the rail stations (Symphony station on the Green line and Mass Ave 
                    station on the Orange line) are used much more often than any of the bus stops. We also
                    learned that "PM Peak" between 4pm and 6:29pm is the busiest time to take public 
                    transportation.
                    <br><br>
                    Through our exploratory data analysis, we discovered that bikes are increasing in
                    number while cars are decreasing in number in the area, which should encourage the 
                    addition of safe bike lanes. Accidents occur most frequently at the intersections of Melnea 
                    Cass and Mass Ave, and Albany St and Mass Ave. We also learned that the MBTA has become 
                    more reliable over the past five years. 
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, we hope that we have been able to offer Chester Square Neighbors some insights
                    into public transportation usage in order to contribute to the advocacy for continued
                    infrastructure investment in the area.
