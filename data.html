            The data in this report was collected from various official City of Boston datasets. The majority of the data 
            used was either quantitative or categorical. Much of the quantitative data included time data and MBTA ridership 
            numbers. The categorical data consisted mostly of representations of various MBTA and Bus lines, as well as 
            categorical time data representing a season, or time of day. The main datasets used in our visualizations were 
            related to MBTA data including MBTA bus ridership by time, MBTA rail ridership by time, and MBTA reliability. 
            We also used the PATI bus stops data set, the current Blue Bikes stations dataset, and data showing bike usage 
            on Mass Ave south of Shawmut.
            <br><br>
            One of the first questions we sought to answer was “what public transportation is available to the community?” 
            In order to provide a visualization for this question, we compiled data from multiple different data sets including 
            MBTA Bus and Rail data and Blue Bike data. Our goal here was to explicitly show what kind of access residents of 
            Mass Ave had to public transportation by showing each stop/station on a map. We combined data from two different 
            datasets that described Blue Bike and bus coordinates respectively, and then manually found the coordinates for 
            the T stations on Google Maps. This dataset provided us with a good start to our visualizations by showing us what 
            existed in the area around the focus portion of Mass Ave.
            <br><br>
            In addition to visualizing public transportation access, we also wanted to look into ridership and reliability data. 
            This was done via our MBTA Bus and MBTA train ridership by time data as well as our MBTA reliability data. These 
            datasets contained a lot of different data but we were focusing on average reliability which was quantitative and 
            average ons which was also quantitative. Again, this data was already formatted well and required little to no 
            cleaning or change. We were able to use this data to visualize MBTA reliability as shown below.
            <br><br>
            Next, we wanted to investigate non-public transportation usage, specifically cars and bikes. The only dataset we 
            had that covered this however was already in a presented, PDF format. In order to format this data the way we wanted 
            we had to transcribe it into a usable CSV format and then we were able to combine car and bike data to see how usage 
            of each changed over time on Mass Ave. These datasets contained mostly quantitative data and we specifically looked 
            at time, number of bicycles, number of motor vehicles, and percentage of bicycles among all vehicles.
            <br><br>
            Once we covered basic availability and usage questions pertaining to transport, we wanted to look into car and 
            bike-related accident data. For this, we turned to our Vision Zero Crash Record dataset. The data we were looking at 
            was mostly quantitative and we specifically looked at quantitative data representing location coordinates as well as 
            categorical data representing specific cross streets along Mass Ave. Using this data we were able to make heat maps 
            showing where accidents mostly occur in the area and we were able to make direct comparisons between important cross 
            streets and the number of accidents they had.
            <br><br>
            Overall the datasets used made it relatively simple to extract the information we needed and visualize what we needed 
            to begin answering our questions.
